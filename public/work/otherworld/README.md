# Otherworld case study media

Upload images here so they appear in the case study page. Use these **exact filenames** with `.jpg` extension (or change the paths in `src/app/work/otherworld/page.tsx` if you use `.png`).

| Filename | Where it appears |
|----------|------------------|
| `brandbook.jpg` | End-to-end brand book block |
| `logo-mark-1.jpg` | Logo mark grid (left) |
| `logo-mark-2.jpg` | Logo mark grid (right) |
| `portal-hero.jpg` | Portal hero block |
| `adaptive-nav.jpg` | Adaptive case navigation block |
| `lets-work-together.jpg` | Let's work together block |
| `animated-404.jpg` | Animated 404 block |

Paths are under `public/work/otherworld/`, so e.g. `public/work/otherworld/portal-hero.jpg` is served as `/work/otherworld/portal-hero.jpg`. If a file is missing, the gray (#EEEEEE) placeholder is shown.
